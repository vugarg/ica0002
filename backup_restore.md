<h1>General provisions</h1>

All services and their configurations can be restored with Ansible playbooks (except for Ansible itself), but if restoration of data or Ansible configuration/playbooks is required then custom solutions are shown.
If restoration of a service is needed to be done through Ansible and it is corrupted or absent then firstly refer to the Ansible - configuration management section to set it up.
Restorations through Ansible playbook should be done in the directory that contains them. All commands are run through console/terminal/command line; from a user "backup" for the restoration of data and configuration without Ansible on the hosts where the service and/or its data should be restored.
If you are starting as a user "ubuntu" you can become user "backup" after running next commands:

```sudo su
su backup
/bin/bash
cd ~
```

#### General services

Ansible - configuration management tool
To restore Ansible and playbooks go through the following options on the management host (or temporary, if management one is unavailable):


* Install Ansible if if it does not exist, otherwise this step can be skipped. There are two options:


1. Install from the repository (escalated privileges required, for that run commands as user "ubuntu"):
```
sudo apt -y install ansible
```

Afterwards PATH="$HOME/ansible-venv/bin:$PATH" string should be added to the .profile file in the /home/<ansible_user>/. The file can be open with a simple console text editor:
```
nano .profile
```


2. Install from the repository into the Python virtual environment, run in /home/<ansible_user>/ directory (escalated privileges and Python3 are required, for that run commands as user "ubuntu"):
```
sudo apt install python3.9
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv ~/ansible-venv
~/ansible-venv/bin/pip install ansible==2.9
~/ansible-venv/bin/ansible --version
```

Afterwards PATH="$HOME/ansible-venv/bin:$PATH" string should be added to the .profile file in the /home/<ansible_user>/. The file can be open with a simple console text editor:
```
nano .profile
```

* Download Ansible repository into its new location if it does not exist. There are two options:


1. Download from GitHub
```
curl -L -o /home/<ansible_user>/ansible --header 'Authorization: token <github_token>' --header "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" https://api.github.com/repos/<username>/<repository_name>/tarball/master
tar -zxf ansible
